The Google Sheets scripts used for a weekly calendar and sorting tasks

These scripts were created to use Google Sheets for simple planning at Version2, but are currently not used.

As stand alone scripts they are not much use since sheet names and cell rows and columns are hardcoded into the scripts and they also rely on Sheets' function for conditional formatting to create a user interfrace.

I'm keeping a copy of the scripts here in case I need them for another project, and since I'm not the owner of the original documents on Google Drive, they could dissappear.
